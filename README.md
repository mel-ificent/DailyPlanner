# DailyPlanner

## Description
This project is to build out a daily planner that allows users to enter tasks in each hour block and save the details to local storage, so that when the page is refreshed their saved planned items are loaded. Additionally, this application uses Moment.js to capture the current date and time so that the user can see which hours are past, present, and future.  A few highlights from this project include:

    ⏰ Use of Moment.js to provide time related feedback to the user (i.e. date at the top, hour blocks highlighted in different colors based on time)
    🌟 Built with JQuery and Bootstrap
    📦 Use of local storage to store planned tasks
